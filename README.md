## Deployment on Vercel

### Quick Deploy

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-benefits-tracker)

### Manual Deployment

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. Login to Vercel:
```bash
vercel login
```

3. Deploy:
```bash
vercel
```

4. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
   - `MONGODB_DB`: Your database name
   - `DELETE_SECRET`: A strong, random secret for delete operations
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: Your production URL

### Environment Variables for Production

In your Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:

- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `MONGODB_DB`: `credit-cards-benefits`
- `DELETE_SECRET`: A strong random string (use a password generator)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

> **Security Note**: Never share your `DELETE_SECRET` publicly. Generate a unique, strong secret for production using tools like `openssl rand -hex 32`.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/cards` - Fetch all cards (with optional platform filter)
- `POST /api/cards` - Create new card-platform combination
- `PUT /api/cards/[id]` - Update existing card
- `DELETE /api/cards/[id]` - Delete card (requires `x-delete-secret` header)
- `GET /api/permissions` - Check read/write permissions

## Data Model

Each card-platform combination includes:
- **Card Name**: e.g., "Chase Sapphire Preferred"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**UI not updating after create/update/delete operations:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure cache invalidation is working properly
- Verify toast notifications are appearing
- Try refreshing the page or clearing browser cache

**Delete operations failing:**
- Verify `DELETE_SECRET` is set in environment variables
- Ensure the secret matches between client and server
- Check network tab for 401 errors

**Toast notifications not appearing:**
- Verify the Toaster component is mounted in the layout
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- Ensure sonner package is properly installed

**Cache issues:**
- Clear browser storage (localStorage)
- Use the refresh button in the manage interface
- Check if cache TTL values are appropriate
